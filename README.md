# Analysis Tips
There are various points which analyst needs to investigate in malware analysis. Here are some tips which are highly effective for the analysis.

| Static Analysis check points  | Comment |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Filetype                         |N/A|
| Packers                          |N/A|
| Timestamps                       |N/A|
| Dll (Libraries)                  |N/A|
| Function (Imports / Exports)     |N/A|
| Strings                          |N/A|
<br>

| Dynamic Analysis check points  | Comment |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Network indicator | In the static analysis phase, you could get some clues related to network activities from string values. For example, you can track the network activities such as HTTP(80), DNS(53) or even filtering some URL keywords by using Wireshark. |
| Host indicator    | In the static analysis phase, you could get some clues related to host activities from string values - PE file, Process, Cmd, Path and so on. You can track PE file/Process activities by filtering additional values in Process Monitor. |

# Analysis Tools 
During basic static/dynamic malware analysis, I usually use these tool and access website as follows: <br>
### Static Analysis 
■ Pestudio (https://www.winitor.com/download) <br>
■ VirusTotal (https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) <br>
■ MalAPI.io (https://malapi.io/)

### Dynamic Analysis 
■ Wireshark (https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) <br>
■ TCPView (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/tcpview) <br>
■ Process Monitor (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) <br>
■ Process Hacker (https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/) <br>
