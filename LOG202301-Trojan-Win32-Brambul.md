## Malware reports
Before I begin the analysis, I looked into a few blogs how this malware is going to behave.

> Brambul malware is a malicious Windows 32-bit SMB worm that functions as a service dynamic link library file or a portable executable file often dropped and installed onto victims’ networks by dropper malware. When executed, the malware attempts to establish contact with victim systems and IP addresses on victims’ local subnets. If successful, the application attempts to gain unauthorized access via the SMB protocol (ports 139 and 445) by launching brute-force password attacks using a list of embedded passwords. Additionally, the malware generates random IP addresses for further attacks.<br>

> Joanap, also known as “Hidden Cobra,” is a remote access tool that it is dropped on infected systems by the automated Brambul worm, which crawls from computer-to-computer and probes whether it can gain access using certain vulnerabilities.
Once installed on an infected computer, Joanap would allow the North Korean hackers to remotely access infected computers, gain root level (or near-total) access to infected computers and load additional malware onto infected computers, the government said. <br>
